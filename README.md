LXST is a simple and flexible real-time streaming format and delivery protocol that allows a wide variety of implementations, while using as little bandwidth as possible. It is built on top of [Reticulum](https://reticulum.network) and offers zero-conf stream routing, end-to-end encryption and Forward Secrecy, and can be transported over any kind of medium that Reticulum supports.

- Cross-platform, works on Linux, Android, Windows and Mac
- Provides a variety of ready-to-use primitives, for easily creating applications such as:
  - Telephony and live voice calls
  - Two-way radio systems
    - Direct peer-to-peer radio communications
    - Trunked and routed real-time radio systems
  - Media streaming
  - Broadcast radio
  - Public address systems
- Can handle real-time signal streams with end-to-end latencies below 10 milliseconds
- Supports encoding and decoding stream contents with a range of different codecs
  - Raw and lossless streams with arbitrary sample rates
    - Up to 32 channels
    - Up to 128-bit sample precision
  - Efficient, high-quality voice and audio with OPUS
    - Many different built-in profiles, from ~4.5kbps to ~96kbps
    - Profiles are pre-tuned for different applications, such as:
      - Low-bandwidth voice
      - Medium quality voice
      - High quality, perceptually lossless voice
      - Media content such as podcasts
      - Perceptually lossless stereo music
  - Ultra low-bandwidth voice communications with Codec2
    - Provides intelligible voice between 700bps and 3200bps
- Can dynamically switch codecs mid-stream without stream re-initialization or frame loss
- Has in-band signalling support for call signalling, communications, metadata embedding, media and stream management
- Uses a fully staged signal pipelining, allowing arbitrary stream routing
- Provides built-in signal mixing support for any number of channels

User-facing clients built on LXST include:

- [Sideband](https://unsigned.io/sideband)
- [MeshChatX](https://meshchatx.com/)
- [Partyline](https://github.com/RFnexus/partyline)
- [Columba](https://github.com/torlando-tech/columba)
- [rnphone](https://reticulum.network/manual/software.html#reticulum-network-telephone)
- [LXST Phone](https://github.com/kc1awv/lxst_phone)

## Transport Encryption

LXST uses encryption provided by [Reticulum](https://reticulum.network), and thus provides end-to-end encryption, guaranteed data integrity and authenticity, as well as forward secrecy by default.

## Project Status & License

This software and its interfaces will change rapidly with ongoing development. Consider no APIs stable. Consider everything explosive. Not all features are implemented. Nothing is documented. For a fully functional LXST program, take a look at [Sideband](https://github.com/markqvist/Sideband) or the included `rnphone` program, which provides telephony service over Reticulum. Everything else will currently be a voyage of your own making.

The LXST project is available under a `CC BY-NC-ND 4.0` license. You can deploy LXST freely for non-commercial, personal and humanitarian purposes. For commercial (including institutionalised educational) licensing, contact me.

## Installation

If you want to try out LXST, you can install it with pip:

```bash
pip install lxst
```

On Raspberry Pi (assuming Trixie / Debian 13), install various dependencies with:

```bash
# Audio codecs
sudo apt install python3-pyaudio codec2

# For hardware control over I2C:
pip install smbus2 --break-system-packages # Install smbus module if not already installed
sudo raspi-config # Enable the I2C bus under "Interface Options"
sudo apt install python3-rpi.gpio # Install gpio module system-wide
```
